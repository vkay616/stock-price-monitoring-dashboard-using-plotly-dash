# stock-price-monitoring-dashboard-using-plotly-dash

Two interactive dashboards built in Python using Plotly-Dash for monitoring stocks prices (NSE only for now).

### Historical Dashboard
Shows opening and closing price of stocks for each day since it was listed on NSE. Dropdown filters for stock symbols and years is present in the dashboard. The data is fetched through yfinance.

### Realtime Dashboard
Displays the current stock value and keeps track of the changing values in a list from the moment the app is run. The realtime data is scraped from Google Finance website using requests and bs4.

###### P.S. I've uploaded the file now but its been a few years since this was made and also I probably tried to improve it but gave up a long time ago so the file can have errors in it or not be functional anymore.
